# Kishore Portfolio (ready-to-deploy)

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind project pre-configured for quick deploy to static hosts like Vercel or Netlify.

## How to deploy to Vercel (drag & drop)
1. Download the ZIP and unzip it.
2. On Vercel dashboard go to **New Project → Import** or use **Drag & Drop Deploy** page: https://vercel.com/new
3. Drag the unzipped folder into Vercel's upload box — Vercel will build and provide a live link.
4. Open the live link and click **Manage** to use the client-side editor (password: `Portfolio@1911`).
